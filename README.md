# MERN
 This project aims to develop a MERN-based real-time chat application
 with Process Scheduling and Background Jobs to enhancemessage
 prioritization, scalability, and security. Unlike traditional chat apps,
 this system will implement First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Priority
 Scheduling to ensure urgent messages (e.g., admin alerts) are processed
 faster. Background jobs will handle offline messaging, spam detection,
 auto-deletion, and notifications asynchronously to improve
 performance and efficiency. Additionally, end-to-end encryption (E2EE),
 AI-powered moderation, and role-based access control (RBAC) will be
 integrated for security and user privacy
